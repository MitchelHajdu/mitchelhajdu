### Hi there! 👋

I'm Mitchel, a 27-year-old full-stack developer based in Kerkrade, Netherlands.  
I specialize in building fast, scalable e-commerce platforms and custom GrandMA3 tools.

Some of my projects include **Yourshops** (a multi-tenant e-commerce system) and **FocusTool** for GrandMA3.  

### No public projects yet ⚡
Most of my work is private, but I’ll be sharing some here soon!

### Questions? 💬
Don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect or have any questions.
